# Wite in Notion enviroment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a detailed bug bounty report suitable for pasting into Notion.

Use clear section headers like:
Title, Description, Impact, Steps to Reproduce, Expected Result, Actual Result, Recommendations, Timeline, and References.

    Use bold text for emphasis.

    Use inline code formatting for payloads or URLs.

    Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.

    Keep it clean, minimal, and readable for a Notion environment (no terminal box, no emojis).

    The report should explain a SQL Injection vulnerability on https://example.com/user.php?name=1, where the name parameter is vulnerable to time-based blind SQLi.

Style it for professional use in a private Notion workspace for internal triage or team collaboration.
